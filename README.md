# Problem statement

   Desire to Receive Care - Due to lack of mental health awareness people in India ignore mental health, and have a very low desire to receive care.

-   Lack of Anonymity When Seeking Treatment - People lack the service of seeking help without revealing their identity, and sometimes for this reason they back off.

-   Shortages of Mental Health Workforce Professionals - The number of psychiatrists in India currently is about 9000 and counting. The doctor/patient ratio was 1:870 (One Psychiatrist) or 1:435 (medical officer + psychiatrist) and a psychiatrist to population ratio of 0.48 per 100,000.
